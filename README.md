# CodeGladiatorDebug
Level 2 of Code Gladiator where we debug C code.

1. Slash character " ⁄ " was not actual slash character. We replaced it using find&replace.
2. Dash "–" was also not actual dash character.
3. Add printf statement at the end to see output

### Our Method:

First I tried to compile but it showed 'stray' error. I opened project in vscode and it highlighted that location with slash. It had a different shape than normal slash. I replaced them all. I also replaced dash character too which was longer than normal dash.

I added printf statement at the end to see output and it was same as tried on paper.
